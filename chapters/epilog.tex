This work introduced SNARKs and provided a high-level overview of the core concepts underlying $\plonk$. The main focus was to explain in detail the $\plonk$ protocol and make it more accessible. Additionally, we explored potential optimization techniques, focusing on reducing the degree of wire polynomials. We discussed various approaches and their potential effectiveness and achieved a minor improvement. However, the best solution remained turned out to be a naive software optimization.
